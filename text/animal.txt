4.4.1 Categorization and learning
Animals can generalize from past experience to form general categories. For
example, pigeons trained on photographs of trees can generalize a concept
of “tree,” such that they recognize novel pictures of trees, detect partially
concealed trees, and silhouettes of trees. While one might think that “tree”
is partly an innate concept for a bird, pigeons show similarly impressive
competence for underwater pictures of fish, or for arbitrary shapes like
the letter “A” (see review in Vauclair, 1996). While it is possible that some
categories are innate (e.g. conspecific faces or calls), many are learned,
and simple associative learning provides a precursor for some of the simple
aspects of reference in human language that are shared among all vertebrates.
4.4.2 Memory
Animals can retain information about an object or a sequence after it has
disappeared. Early work showed that monkeys and apes readily remember
under which of several cups food had been hidden (Tinklepaugh, 1928).
Pigeons can remember at least 160 meaningless “squiggles,” or 320 natural
scenes, for at least a year (Vaughan and Greene, 1984). In the so-called
delayed matchto sampletask, monkeys presented with an object can correctly
report whether a second object or sequence is the same or different (Fobes
and King, 1982).
4.4.3 Time and planning
The adaptive value of memory is that it helps animals make decisions and
plan future behavior. Animals can predict where a rotating clock hand
