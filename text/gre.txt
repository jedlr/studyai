So How Do You Score High on
the Analytical Writing Essays?
On the face of it, you might think it would be pretty difficult to impress these
jaded readers, but it turns out that there are some very specific ways to persuade them of your superior writing skills.
in a recent analysis of a group of essays written by actual test takers, and the grades that those essays received, ETS researchers noticed that the most successful essays had one thing in common. Which of the following characteristics do you think it was?
• • • • • •
Good organization
Proper diction
Noteworthy ideas
Good vocabulary
Sentence variety
Length
What Your Essay Needs in Order to
Look Like a Successful Essay
The ETS researchers discovered that the essays that received the highest grades from ETS essay graders had one single factor in common: length.
To ace the Analytical Writing section, you need to take one simple step: Write as much as you possibly can. Each essay should include at least four indented paragraphs. Your Issue essay should be 400 to 750 words in length, and your
Argument essay should be 350 to 600 words.
So Ali i Have to Do Is Type "I Hate the GRE"
Over and Over Again?
Well, no. The length issue isn't that easy. The ETS researchers also noted that, not surprisingly, the high-scoring essays all made reasonably good points addressing the topic. So you have to actually write something that covers the essay topic. And in your quest for length, it's more important that you add depth than breadth. What this means is that it's better to have a few good examples that are thoroughly and deeply explored than it is to add length by tacking more and more exam­ ples and paragraphs onto your essay until it starts to feel like a superficial list of bulleted points rather than a thoughtful piece ofwriting.
ou should read the directions for each essay prompt. The instructions we provide here for each essay task are not necessarily the ones you will see on the GRE. Directions can vary in focus, so you shouldn't memorize any particular set of instructions. Visit the ETS website at ww.w gre.org for a complete list of all the potential essay topics and direction variants. (Yes, you really get to see this information in advance of the test!) Practice responding to the different instruc­ tions, combined with a variety of issue and argument prompts. Be sure to mix it up; the prompt/directions pairings you see on the ETS website are not necessarily the duos you will see on the real test. Practicing with a variety of these essays will prepareyouforwhatevercomesyourwayontestday.
Oh, Yes, You Can Plan Your Essays in Advance
In fact, there are some very specific ways to prepare for the essays that go beyond length and good typing skills. So how can you prepare ahead oftime?
When a builder builds a house, the first thing he does is construct a frame. The frame supports the entire house. After the frame is completed, he can nail the walls and windows to the frame. We're going to show you how to build the frame for the perfect GRE essay. Of course, you won't know the exact topic of the essay until you get there (just as the builder may not know what color his client is going to paint the living room), but you will have an all-purpose frame on which to construct a great essay no matter what the topic is. We call this frame the template.
Preconstruction
Just as a builder can construct the windows of a house in his workshop weeks before he arrives to install them, so can you pre-build certain elements of your essay. We call this "preconstruction."
In the· next two chapters we'll show you how to prepare ahead of time to write essays on �wo topics that you won't see until they appear on your screen.
It is worth noting at this time that the essay section gives you two very distinct writing tasks, and that a failure to appropriately address the question tasks will severely reduce your score.
The Issue Essay
The Issue essay asks for your opinion; you're expected to present your viewpoint on a particular topic and support that viewpoint with various examples. The follow­ ing is one example of the instructions for the Issue essay:
You will be given a brief quotation that states or implies an issue of general interest and specific instructions on how to respond to that issue.
You will have 30 minutes to plan and compose
a response in which you develop a position on
the issue according to the specific instructions. A response to any other issue will receive a score of zero.
Make sure that you respond to the specific instructions and support your position on the issue with reasons and examples drawn from such areas as your reading, experience, observations, and/or academic studies.
Note how important it is to specifically address the assignment provided as part of the Issue prompt; not following ETS's directions will make your grader unhappy and result in a poor score on the essay.
The Argument essay requires a different type of response. Instead of presenting your own perspective, your job is to critique someone else's argument. You're sup­ posed to address the logical flaws of the argument, not provide your personal opinion on the subject. The following is one example of the directions for the Argument essay:
You will be given a short passage that presents
an argument, or an argument to be completed,
and specific instructions on how to respond to
that passage. You will have 30 minutes to plan
and compose a response in which you analyze the passage according to the specific instructions. A response to any other argument will receive a score of zero.
Note that you are NOT being asked to present
your own views on the subject. Make sure that you respond to the specific instructions and support your analysis with relevant reasons and/or examples.
In the Argument essay, the emphasis is on writing a logical analysis of the argu­ ment, not an opinion piece. It is absolutely essential that you don't confuse the two essay tasks on the GRE.
HOW DOES THE WORD-PROCESSING
PROGRAM WORK?
ETS has created a very simple program that allows students to compose their essays on the screen. Compared to any of the commercial word-processing pro­ grams, this one is extremely limited, but it does allow the basic functions: You can move the cursor with the arrow keys, and you can delete, copy, and paste. If you're a computer novice, don't worry. You don't have to use any of these functions. With just the backspace key and the mouse to change your point of insertion, you will be able to use the computer like a regular word-processing program.
The question will always appear at the top left of your screen. Beside it, in a box, will be your writing area (in the writing area above, you can see a partially com­ pleted sentence). When you click inside the box with your mouse, a winking cur­ sor will appear, indicating that you can begin typing. As we said above, the pro­ gram supports the use of many of the normal computer keys:
•

The "Backspace" key removes text to the left of the cursor.
The "Delete" key removes text to the right of the cursor.
The "Arrow" keys move the cursor up, down, left, or right.
The "Home" key moves the cursor to the beginning of a line.
The "End" key moves the cursor to the end of a line.
The "Enter" key moves the cursor to the beginning of the next line.
"Page up" moves the cursor up one page.
"Page down" moves the cursor down one page.
You can also use the buttons above the writing area to c
copy and paste words, sen­ tences, or paragraphs. To do this, you first have to highlight the desired text by clicking on the starting point with your mouse and holding down the mouse button while you drag it to the ending point. Then click on the "Cut" button. This deletes the text you've selected from the screen, but also stores it in the com­ puter's memory. Next, just move the cursor to wherever you would like the selected text to reappear, and click on the "Paste" button. The selected text will appear in that spot.
If you make a mistake, simply click on the "Undo" button, which will undo what­ ever operation you have just done. You can undo a cut, a paste, or even the last set of words you've typed in. Unfortunately, unlike many word-processing programs, ETS's program does not have a "Redo" button, so be careful what you decide to undo.
Obviously, the small box on the screen is not big enough to contain your entire essay. However, by hitting the "Page up" and "Page down" keys on your keyboard, or by using the arrows on your keyboard, you will be able to go forward and back­
ward to reread what you have written and make corrections.
Officially, no. The word-processing program doesn't have a spell checker, and ETS essay readers are supposed to ignore minor errors ofspelling and grammar, but the readers wouldn't be human if they weren't influenced by an essay that had lots of spelling mistakes and improper grammar-it gives the impression that you just didn't care enough to proofread.
Because pervasive spelling errors will detract from your score, pick an easier word if you're really uncertain of how to spell a word.
Summary
0 Different programs value the essay section in different ways. Check with your program to see how important the essays are.
0 Understand the criteria ETS uses for judging your essay. Organization, examples, and lan- guage use are important. Perfect grammar and
spelling less so.
0 On the GRE, longer essays tend to receive bet- ter scores, so strive to write as much as you can for each essay.
Make sure you understand the differences in the assignments for the Issue essay and the Argument essay.
while Argument essays expect you to critique the logic of an argument. The ways in which you're asked to do each of these tasks will vary, so make sure you read each set of directions carefully.
The word processor ETS provides has only the most basic functions. You can delete, copy, and paste text, but not much more.
